    <h1> ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p> Lebanese people love to be in the know about everything, and I am no exception! Since childhood, I would pour
      over local and foreign newspapers. My taste has evolved from Newsweek to L Orient le Jour and The Wall Street
      Journal. I enjoy reading The Atlantic for its flow and broad-interest articles. I ve found that BBC News
      reporting on international politics avoids the bias and partisanship found in other news sources. I love the
      sub-journals of Science Magazine and, even though some of the articles are really advanced, there are plenty
      that bring new and exciting discoveries and advancements to the public interest. My family has an old collection
      of National Geographic magazines and I never tire of perusing the beauty and adventure within their pages.
      THAT'S WHY I'M DEVELOPING THIS WEBSITE: LET'S SRPEAD AWARENESS BY SHARING DAILY CONTENT WORLDWIDE!!

      Coming from Lebanon, I constantly check the news of my home country and stay updated about everything that is happening in my native land.Being a soccer fanatic, I was really disappointed after having recieved the news that one of my favorite lebanese soccer player died. Prominent Lebanese footballer Mohamed Atwi died of a bullet wound reportedly sustained during the funeral for one of the victims of last month's massive explosion at the port of the capital, Beirut, according to his club and local media.The 32-year-old played as a midfielder for a number of Lebanese clubs and won the national league three times with Beirut's Ansar, his club for almost 10 years.
      Tributes poured in for the player, who was also capped three times for his country.

"A sad day for sport," Wael Chehayeb, an official with his latest club Al-Akhaa al-Ahly, wrote on social media, calling Atwi "a great for Lebanese football".
