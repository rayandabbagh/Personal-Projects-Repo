            Charitable giving continued its upward trend in 2017, as an estimated $410.02 billion was given to
            charitable causes. For the third year in a row, total giving reached record levels. This increase and the
            overall size of charitable contributions is further testament to the integral role charities play in our
            society, a role which continues to grow.As in previous years, the majority of that giving came from
            individuals. Specifically, individuals gave $286.65 billion, accounting for 70% of all giving and
            representing a 3.0% increase over 2016. Giving by bequest increased by 2.3% to $35.70 billion (9% of all
            donations). Foundations - which includes grants made by independent, community, and operating foundations -
            gave $66.9 billion (16% of all donations). This represents a 6% increase over the prior year. Corporations
            grew by 8% to $20.77 billion (5% of all donations).Historically, donations from individuals account for over
            two-thirds of all donations. If you add in gifts from bequests, then the category accounts for nearly 80% of
            all giving. In other words, the donating public, not big foundations or corporations, is responsible for the
            vast majority of annual donations. 
            This subject is indeed a subject of interest to me. Since childhood,a phrase would always come to mind: "To whom much is given, much will be required." I take these words for my own mantra. It has been the catalyst for my own future. I want to make an impact, to beneficially contribute to our world's progress, which I know that I can do well.  I want to make my life's work one of significance and play the hand I was dealt in order to give back.I realized that the bulk of my personal fulfilment is based upon my ability to make life better: not only mine, but that of others. I will only then feel that I have truly succeeded. I am here, and I have something great to contribute.That's why i based my research on "donations" in the USA.
